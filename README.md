# Integreatly Operator

A Kubernetes Operator based on the Operator SDK for installing and reconciling Integreatly products.

## Current status

This is a PoC / alpha version. Most functionality is there but it is higly likely there are bugs and improvements needed

## Supported Custom Resources

The following custom resources are supported:

- `Installation`

## Local Setup

Create the [`OperatorSource`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/manifests/master/operator-source.yml) in OpenShift:
```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/manifests/master/operator-source.yml
```

Create the Installation `CustomResourceDefinition` in OpenShift:
```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/master/deploy/crds/installation.crd.yaml
```

Create the Namespace/Project for the Integreatly Operator to watch:
```sh
oc new-project <namespace>
```

- Some products will need AWS credentials so create 2 secrets in the Namespace/Project for the Integreatly Operator
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
	name: s3-credentials
	namespace: <installation-namespace>
stringData:
	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: <your-aws-access-key>
	AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: <your-aws-secret-key>
```
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
	name: s3-bucket
	namespace: <installation-namespace>
stringData:
	AWS_BUCKET: <an-aws-s3-bucket-name>
	AWS_REGION: <region-s3-bucket-name-is-in>
```

Create the `Installation` resource in the namespace we created:
```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/master/deploy/crds/examples/installation.cr.yaml
```

Create the `Role`, `RoleBinding` and `ServiceAccount`:
```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/master/deploy/service_account.yaml
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/master/deploy/role.yaml
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/master/deploy/role_binding.yaml
```

Clone this repository, change directory and run the operator:
```sh
operator-sdk up local --namespace=<namespace>
```

In the OpenShift UI, in `Projects -> openshift-rhsso -> Networking -> Routes`, select the URL for the `sso` Route to open up the SSO login page.

The username is `admin`, and the password can be retrieved by running:
```sh
oc get dc sso -n openshift-rhsso -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[?(@.name=="SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD")].value}'
```


## Deploying to a Cluster with OLM

Create the [`OperatorSource`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/manifests/master/operator-source.yml) in the cluster:
```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/integr8ly/manifests/master/operator-source.yml
```

Within a few minutes, the Integreatly operator should be visible in the OperatorHub (`Catalog > OperatorHub`). To create a new subscription, click on the Install button, choose an installation mode and keep the approval strategy on automatic.


Once the subscription shows a status of `installed`, a new Integreatly Installation Custom Resource (CR) can be created which will begin to install the supported services. In `Catalog > Developer Catalog`, choose the Integreatly Installation and click Install. An example installation CR can be found below:

```yml
apiVersion: integreatly.org/v1alpha1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: example-installation
spec:
  type: workshop
namespacePrefix: integreatly-
```

## Tests

Running unit tests:

```sh
make test/unit
```

## Release

Update operator version files:

* Bump [operator version](version/version.go)
```Version = "<version>"```
* Bump [makefile TAG](Makefile)
```TAG=<version>```
* Bump [operator image version](deploy/operator.yaml)
```image: quay.io/integreatly/integreatly-operator:v<version>```

Commit changes and open pull request.

When the PR is accepted, create a new release tag:

```sh
git tag v<version> && git push upstream v<version>
```
