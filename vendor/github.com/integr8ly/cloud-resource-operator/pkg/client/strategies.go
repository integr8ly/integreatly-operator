/*
Strategy Setup

A utility to abstract the various strategy map ConfigMaps from the service using CRO (RHMI)

Problem Statement:
 - We require strategy map ConfigMaps to be in place to provide configuration used to provision cloud resources
 - Each provider overrides null configuration with expected RHMI specific defaults
 - Non null configuration provided via strategy map is consumed by CRO as configuration for the provisioning of cloud resources
 - Strategy maps provide the source of truth for the expected state of a cloud resource
 - Strategy maps are used to update and modify the state of provisioned cloud resources

This utility provides the abstraction necessary, provisioning a strategy map for the infrastructure in which the operator is currently running in

We accept start times for maintenance and backup times as a level of abstraction
Building the correct maintenance and backup times necessary for specific cloud providers
