# N01 - Mesure downtime during OpenShift upgrade

## Description

Mesure the downtime of the RHMI components during the OpenShift upgrade (not to be confused with the RHMI upgrade) to ensure OpenShift can be safely upgraded.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed locally
- [oc CLI v4.3](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli)
- [ocm CLI](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli/releases) installed locally
- [jq v1.6](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases) installed locally

## Steps

1. Login via `oc` as a user with **cluster-admin** role (kubeadmin):

   ```
   oc login --token=<TOKEN> --server=https://api.<CLUSTER_NAME>.s1.devshift.org:6443
   ```

2. Make sure **nobody is using the cluster** for performing the test cases, because the RHMI components will have a downtime during the upgrade

3. Clone [delorean](https://github.com/integr8ly/delorean) repo and run the `measure-downtime.js` script:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/integr8ly/delorean
   cd delorean/scripts/ocm
   node measure-downtime.js
   ```

4. In terminal window #2, run the following command to trigger the OpenShift upgrade

   ```bash
   oc adm upgrade --to-latest=true
   ```

   > You should see the message saying the upgrade of the OpenShift cluster is triggered

5. Ask QE team to login to the ocm staging environment and get the ID of the cluster that is going to be upgraded:

   ```bash
   # Get the token at https://qaprodauth.cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token
   ocm login --url=https://api.stage.openshift.com --token=YOUR_TOKEN
   CLUSTER_ID=$(ocm cluster list | grep <CLUSTER-NAME> | awk '{print $1}')
   ```

6. Ask QE team to run this command to wait for the OpenShift upgrade to complete:

   ```bash
   watch -n 60 "ocm get cluster $CLUSTER_ID | jq -r .metrics.upgrade.state | grep -q completed && echo 'Upgrade completed\!'"
   ```

   > This script will run every 60 seconds to check whether the OpenShift upgrade has finished
   >
   > Once it's finished, it should print out "Upgrade completed!" (it could take ~1 hour)

7. Go to the OpenShift console, go through all the `redhat-rhmi-` prefixed namespaces and verify that all routes (Networking -> Routes) of RHMI components are accessible

   > If some of the routes are not accessible, try again later. If they won't come up in the end, report the issue.

8. Terminate the process for measuring the downtime of components in terminal window #1

   > It takes couple of seconds until all results are collected
   >
   > The results will be written down to the file `downtime.json`

9. Upload that file to the JIRA ticket

10. Consult the results with engineering (especially in case some components have a long downtime or are not working properly)
