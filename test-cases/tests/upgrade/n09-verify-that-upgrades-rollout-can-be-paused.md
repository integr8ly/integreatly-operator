# N09 - Verify that upgrades rollout can be paused

## Description

We need to have a way of pausing upgrades to prevent upgrade of the whole fleet in a scenario where we discover a critical regression in latest RHMI version, after it has been promoted to production environment.

## Prerequisites

- pre-upgrade cluster
- VPN connection
- familiarity with managed tenants repo and release process

## Steps

1. Change RHMIConfig on a pre-upgrade cluster to postpone upgrades for later.
   `oc patch rhmiconfig.integreatly.org rhmi-config -n redhat-rhmi-operator --type json -p '[{"op":"replace", "path":"/spec/upgrade/notBeforeDays", "value":"7"},{"op":"replace", "path":"/spec/upgrade/waitForMaintenance", "value":"true"}]' -o yaml`
2. Publish new version into the managed tenants repo(MT). This is a standard step, described in the [Release process document](https://github.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/blob/master/RELEASE.md). You will need cooperation with release coordinator for this step.
3. Verify that InstallPlan for rhmi-operator was created but not apprroved. This could take up to 30mins.
   `oc get installplans -n redhat-rhmi-operator`
4. Verify that RHMIConfig status shows scheduled upgrade
   `oc get rhmiconfig.integreatly.org rhmi-config -n redhat-rhmi-operator -o yaml -o jsonpath="status"`
5. Follow this SOP in "stage" environment: https://github.com/RHCloudServices/integreatly-help/blob/master/sops/2.x/cssre_info/info_cssre_stopping_version_rollout.md
6. Verify that InstallPlan for the new version was deleted and RHMIConfig status no longer shows scheduled upgrade. This could take up to 30mins.
   `oc get installplans -n redhat-rhmi-operator`
   `oc get rhmiconfig.integreatly.org rhmi-config -n redhat-rhmi-operator -o yaml -o jsonpath="status"`
