# H01 - UPS: Verify that UPS can send push notification

## Prerequisites

- real Android device with latest OS version
- real iOS device with latest OS version
- Apple Developer Program Account (this is not normal Apple account, but paid one)
- Apple Mac

## Steps

### Android preparation

1. `git clone https://github.com/aerogear/unifiedpush-cookbook.git`
2. `cd unifiedpush-cookbook/cordova/HelloWorld`
3. Follow instructions in the [README](https://github.com/aerogear/unifiedpush-cookbook/tree/master/cordova/HelloWorld)

### iOS

1. `git clone https://github.com/aerogear/unifiedpush-cookbook.git`
2. `cd unifiedpush-cookbook/cordova/HelloWorld`
3. Replace the bundleId with your bundleId (the one associated with your certificate), by editing the config.xml at the root of this project, change the id attribute of the widget node.
4. `cordova platform add ios`
5. `open platforms/ios/AeroGear\ UnifiedPush\ HelloWorld.xcworkspace`
6. In signing settings select your your apple developer account under `Team`
7. Follow the [official Apple guide](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devdfd3d04a1) to enable push notifications for your Xcode project.
