# H22 - Validate that Rate Limit service is working as expected

## Description

This test case should prove that the rate limiting Redis counter correctly increases with every request made

## Steps

1. Open Openshift Console in your browser
2. Copy `oc login` command and login to your cluster in the terminal
3. Start the automated test run
   ```sh
   ./test/scripts/products/h22-validate-that-rate-limit-service-is-working-as-expected/test.sh | tee test-output.txt
   ```
4. Wait for the test to finish. Ensure that it finished successfully, the output
   should look like this:
