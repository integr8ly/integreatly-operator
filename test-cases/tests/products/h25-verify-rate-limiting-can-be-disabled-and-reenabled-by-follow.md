# H25 - Verify rate limiting can be disabled and re-enabled by following the SOP

## Description

> Note: double-check that workload webapp is not already deployed before attempting to deploy it by checking if `workload-web-app` namespace exists in the cluster.

This test case should prove that it is possible for SRE to disable/enable rate limiting service without affecting the RHOAM services availability

## Prerequisites

- access to `cloud-services-qe-reporting@redhat.com` mailing list
- [workload webapp](https://github.com/integr8ly/workload-web-app) should be running on the cluster https://github.com/integr8ly/workload-web-app/

## Steps

1. Go to https://github.com/RHCloudServices/integreatly-help/blob/master/sops/rhoam/rate-limit/disable.md
2. Follow and validate the steps in SOP for disabling rate limit service
3. Open the RHOAM Grafana Console in the `redhat-rhmi-observability` namespace

```bash
open "https://$(oc get route grafana-route -n redhat-rhoam-observability -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
```

4. Select the **Workload App** dashboard
   > Validate that requests to 3scale application are not failing after rate limiting service was disabled
   > Note: Downtime of up to 5 minutes is acceptable as per the service definition
5. Search for alerts in `cloud-services-qe-reporting@redhat.com` mailing list
   > Make sure no critical alert is firing (you might see some alerts with severity "warning")
6. Follow and validate the steps in SOP for re-enabling rate limit service
7. Go back to **Workload App** dashboard
   > Validate that requests to 3scale application are not failing after rate limiting service was enabled again
   > Note: Downtime of up to 5 minutes is acceptable as per the service definition
8. Open the RHOAM Grafana Console in the `redhat-rhoam-customer-monitoring-operator` namespace

```bash
open "https://$(oc get route grafana-route -n redhat-rhoam-customer-monitoring-operator -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
```

9. Validate that the requests made by workload-web-app are displaying in the graphs
10. Search for alerts in `cloud-services-qe-reporting@redhat.com` mailing list
    > Make sure no critical alert is firing (you might see some alerts with severity "warning")
