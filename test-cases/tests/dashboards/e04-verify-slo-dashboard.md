# E04 - Verify SLO dashboard

Note: this test should only be performed at a time it will not affect other ongoing testing, or on a separate cluster. Also due to known issues with the 3scale, CodeReady, Solution Explorer, and UPS operators pods for these products will need to be brought back up manually.

## Steps

1. Make sure that there is at least one active alert for every panel in SLO dasboard (e.g. pod_down)
   1. Make sure rhmi-operator pod is scaled down to 0 pods
   2. Make sure all rhmi product operator pods are scaled down to 0, you can use code #1 below
   3. Make sure all keycloak stateful sets are scaled down to 0, you can use code #2 and #3 below
   4. Make sure all product pods are scaled down to 0, you can use code #4 below
2. Check the dashboard `Critical SLO summary` after some time (~20min)
   > All panels should show alerts firing
3. Bring back up the pods in the 3scale, CodeReady, Solution Explorer, and UPS namespaces
   > redhat-rhmi-3scale -> Workloads -> Deployment Configs -> Scale to 1
   > redhat-rhmi-codeready-workspaces -> Workloads -> Deployments -> Scale to 1
   > redhat-rhmi-solution-explorer -> Workloads -> Deployment Configs -> Scale to 1
   > redhat-rhmi-ups -> Workloads -> Deployments -> Scale to 1

### Code #1

```bash
NS_PREFIX="redhat-rhmi"

namespaces=("3scale-operator" "amq-online" "apicurito-operator" "codeready-workspaces-operator" "fuse-operator" "rhsso-operator" "solution-explorer-operator" "ups-operator" "user-sso-operator")

while true; do
  echo "scaling down"

  for proj in ${namespaces[@]}; do

    project="$NS_PREFIX-$proj"

    for deployment in `oc get deployment -n $project -o json |  jq -r '.items[].metadata.name' | grep operator`; do
      if oc get deployment $deployment -n $project -o json | jq '.spec.replicas' | grep -v 0; then
        echo "scaling down $deployment"
        oc scale deployment $deployment --replicas=0 -n $project
      fi
    done

    for dc in `oc get dc -n $project -o json |  jq -r '.items[].metadata.name' | grep operator`; do
      if oc get dc $dc -n $project -o json | jq '.spec.replicas' | grep -v 0; then
        echo "scaling down $dc"
        oc scale dc $dc --replicas=0 -n $project
      fi
    done

  done
done
```

### Code #2

```bash
while true; do   if oc get deployment keycloak-operator -n redhat-rhmi-rhsso-operator -o json | jq '.spec.replicas' | grep 1; then     oc scale deployment keycloak-operator --replicas=0 -n redhat-rhmi-rhsso-operator;   fi;   if oc get statefulset keycloak -n redhat-rhmi-rhsso -o json | jq '.spec.replicas' | grep 2; then     oc scale statefulset keycloak --replicas=0 -n redhat-rhmi-rhsso;   fi;   sleep 5; done
```

### Code #3

```bash
while true; do   if oc get deployment keycloak-operator -n redhat-rhmi-user-sso-operator -o json | jq '.spec.replicas' | grep 1; then     oc scale deployment keycloak-operator --replicas=0 -n redhat-rhmi-user-sso-operator;   fi;   if oc get statefulset keycloak -n redhat-rhmi-user-sso -o json | jq '.spec.replicas' | grep 2; then     oc scale statefulset keycloak --replicas=0 -n redhat-rhmi-user-sso;   fi;   sleep 5; done
```

### Code #4

```bash
NS_PREFIX="redhat-rhmi"

namespaces=("3scale" "amq-online" "apicurito" "codeready-workspaces" "fuse" "rhsso" "solution-explorer" "ups" "user-sso")

while true; do
  echo "scaling down"

  for proj in ${namespaces[@]}; do

    project="$NS_PREFIX-$proj"

    for deployment in `oc get deployment -n $project -o json |  jq -r '.items[].metadata.name' | grep -v operator`; do
      if oc get deployment $deployment -n $project -o json | jq '.spec.replicas' | grep -v 0; then
        echo "scaling down $deployment"
        oc scale deployment $deployment --replicas=0 -n $project
      fi
    done

    for dc in `oc get dc -n $project -o json |  jq -r '.items[].metadata.name' | grep -v operator`; do
      if oc get dc $dc -n $project -o json | jq '.spec.replicas' | grep -v 0; then
        echo "scaling down $dc"
        oc scale dc $dc --replicas=0 -n $project
      fi
    done

  done
done
