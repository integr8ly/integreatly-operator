# J05B - Verify 3scale backup and restore

## Description

Note: this test should only be performed at a time it will not affect other ongoing testing, or on a separate cluster.
In case the current cluster is not available for some reason, you can perform this test case on the "fresh install" cluster

## Prerequisites

- yq
- jq
- oc
- aws

## Steps

### Postgres

1. Login via `oc` as **kubeadmin**

2. Verify data exist in postgres.

Create a throwaway Postgres instance to access the RHSSO Postgres instance

```sh
cat << EOF | oc create -f - -n redhat-rhoam-operator
  apiVersion: integreatly.org/v1alpha1
  kind: Postgres
  metadata:
    name: throw-away-postgres
    labels:
      productName: productName
  spec:
    secretRef:
      name: throw-away-postgres-sec
    tier: development
    type: workshop
EOF
```

```
# Wait until the throwaway Postgres instance is running
oc get pods -n redhat-rhoam-operator | grep throw-away | awk '{print $3}'
# oc rsh to the pod
oc rsh -n redhat-rhoam-operator $(oc get pods -n redhat-rhoam-operator | grep throw-away | awk '{print $1}')
# password and host retrieved from threescale-postgres-rhoam secret in redhat-rhoam-operator, psql will prompt for password
psql --host=<<db host> --port=5432 --username=postgres --password --dbname=postgres
$ select * from plans;
$ select * from accounts;
```

Once verified, delete the throwaway Postgres

```sh
oc delete -n redhat-rhoam-operator postgres/throw-away-postgres
```

3. **Non-STS** - Run the backup and restore script

```sh
cd test/scripts/backup-restore
./j05-verify-3scale-postgres-backup-and-restore.sh | tee test-output.txt
```

4. **STS** - Reach out to QE for the `osdCcsAdmin` credentials in order to run the backup and restore script

```sh
cd test/scripts/backup-restore
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws_access_key_id> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws_secret_access_key> NS_PREFIX=redhat-rhoam ./j05-verify-3scale-postgres-backup-and-restore.sh | tee test-output.txt
```

4. Wait for the script to finish without errors
5. Verify in the `test-output.txt` log that the test finished successfully.

**Note**
Sometimes there could be a difference between the DB dump files, caused by a changed order of lines in these files. That is not considered to be an issue. More details: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGDAPI-2380

### Redis

Note: certain parts of the SOPs might not be fully updated to RHOAM, so you might need to do simple replacements of RHMI namespaces with RHOAM namespaces.

Note: some AWS CLI commands do not specify region, either specify the region where your cluster is hosted per command via `--region <region-name>` or do it globally via `aws configure`.

Note: make sure you have proper AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY set for AWS CLI

#### Backend Redis

1. Follow [sop](https://github.com/RHCloudServices/integreatly-help/blob/master/sops/2.x/backup_restore/3scale_backup.md#backend-redis)

#### System Redis

1. Follow [sop](https://github.com/RHCloudServices/integreatly-help/blob/master/sops/2.x/backup_restore/3scale_backup.md#system-redis)

### System App

1. Once all pods are up and running follow [sop](https://github.com/RHCloudServices/integreatly-help/blob/master/sops/2.x/backup_restore/3scale_backup.md#system-app) and verify 3scale service is working
