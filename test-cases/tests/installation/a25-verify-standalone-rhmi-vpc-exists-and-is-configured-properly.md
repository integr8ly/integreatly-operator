# A25 - Verify standalone RHMI VPC exists and is configured properly

https://github.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/blob/master/test/functional/aws_standalone_vpc.go

## Description

This test case should verify that standalone VPC was created in AWS and it is configured properly
More info: <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/INTLY-8098>

It is not valid for RHMI clusters upgraded from previous versions (<2.5.0)

## Prerequisites

- admin access to the AWS account where the OpenShift cluster is provisioned (IAM access key & secret)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) installed locally
- [OCM CLI](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli/releases) and access to ocm organization where the cluster has been provisioned

## Steps

1. Login via `oc` as a user with **cluster-admin** role (kubeadmin):

```
oc login --token=<TOKEN> --server=https://api.<CLUSTER_NAME>.s1.devshift.org:6443
```

2. Note down CIDR block from `cloud-resources-aws-strategies` config map (search for `_network` field)

```
oc get configmap cloud-resources-aws-strategies -n redhat-rhmi-operator -o yaml
```

3. Get OSD cluster Infra ID and note it down

```
CID=$(ocm get cluster <cluster-id> | jq -r .infra_id)
```

4. List the VPCs in AWS account

```
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filter "Name=tag-value,Values=$CID"
```

> Verify that the VPC was created and verify that the CIDR block is the same as the one previously noted

5. Following list of verification steps are effectively covered by the functional test
   Note: correct tag for the AWS resources: (Key: `integreatly.org/clusterID`, Value: `<cluster-infra-id>`)

> - Standalone VPC subnet exists and has the expected CIRD block
>
> - There are 2 VPC private subnets in total and the subnet masks for the subnets are one bit greater than the VPC subnet mask. Also both subnets are in different Availability Zones.
>
> - Single VPC security groups with the correct tag exists and has the ingress rules to except all traffic from the Cluster VPC
>
> - There should be 2 RDS subnets, they match previously found subnets and both exist in a single subnet group
>
> - There should be 2 Elasticache subnets, they match previously found subnets and both exist in a single subnet group
>
> - Single VPC peering connection status is active, the requester is the Standalone VPC and the Accepter is a Cluster VPC
>
> - Standalone VPC route table exists, has the correct tag and has a route targeting the peering connection
>
> - Cluster route tables with the correct tag exist and contain a route to the peering connection and the standalone vpc
>
> Verify no new VPC is created when the CIDR block is updated in the \_network section of the `cloud-resources-aws-strategies` config map
