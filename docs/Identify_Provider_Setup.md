# 	Identity Provider setup
### Set up testing IDP for OSD cluster
You can use the `scripts/setup-sso-idp.sh` script to setup a "testing-idp" realm in a cluster SSO instance and add it as IDP of your OSD cluster.
With this script you will get few regular users - test-user[01-10] and few users that will be added to dedicated-admins group - customer-admin[01-03].

Prerequisites:
- `oc` command available on your machine (the latest version can be downloaded [here](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/latest/))
- `ocm` command available ( the newest CLI can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli/releases) and you install it with `mv (your downloaded file) /usr/local/bin/ocm`) (necessary only if using OSD cluster)
- OC session with cluster admin permissions in a target cluster
- OCM session (necessary only if using OSD cluster)
- `openssl` command available on your machine

### Configuring Github OAuth

*Note:* Following steps are only valid for OCP4 environments and will not work on OSD due to the Oauth resource being periodically reset by Hive.

Follow [docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-github-identity-provider.html#identity-provider-registering-github_configuring-github-identity-provider) on how to register a new Github Oauth application and add the necessary authorization callback URL for your cluster as outlined below:

```
https://oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster-name>.<cluster-domain>/oauth2callback/github
```

Once the Oauth application has been registered, navigate to the Openshift console and complete the following steps:

*Note:* These steps need to be performed by a cluster admin

- Select the `Search` option in the left-hand nav of the console and select `Oauth` from the "Resources" dropdown
- A single Oauth resource should exist named `cluster`, click into this resource
- Scroll to the bottom of the console and select the `Github` option from the `add` dropdown
- Next, add the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` of the registered Github Oauth application
- Ensure that the Github organization from where the Oauth application was created is specified in the Organization field
- Once happy that all necessary configurations have been added, click the `Add` button
- For the validation purposes, log into the Openshift console from another browser and check that the Github IDP is listed on the login screen
